# Fake-App-Detection-Android-iOS-

# Description:
It is a system that can spot and remove fake mobile apps—especially those pretending to be banks, UPI apps, shopping apps, or well-known brands. These fake apps appear both in official app stores and on random APK-download websites.


# Kinds of fake apps:-
-	Clones: Look exactly like the real app.
-	Typosquats: Have similar names (e.g., “PayTM Secure” instead of “Paytm”).
-	Overlay/Phishing apps: Show fake login screens on top of real apps.
-	“Update” scams: Pretend to be an urgent update for a popular app.
-	Brand-jacking: Steal brand icons, names, or colors to fool users.

# Features:-
The system will look for suspicious signals such as:
-	App name or package name looks similar to a real brand.
-	Icon or screenshots look too close to a genuine app.
-	Certificates or signing keys don’t match the official app.
-	Publisher account looks shady or newly created.
-	Fake reviews, repeated patterns, or bot-like activity.
-	Weird spikes in downloads from unknown or risky websites.
-	Strange combinations of SDKs used by malware.
